# Signup Form

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.6.

This is a signup form, built with Angular and Angular Material for the styling. 
Validators have been applied to every field of the form and asynchronous validation for the email for checking if the email already exists. 
In the case the email exists, the user cannot submit the form and a corresponding error message appears.
Also, the user gets informed whether his submission has been successful or has been failed.
