# Signup Form

#### Live demo: https://ennadev.github.io/signup-form/

This is a demonstration of a signup form with validations. The project is built with Angular 10 and Angular Material for the styling. 
Key concepts:
- Required validator for all fields.
- Asynchronous validation for checking if the email already exists.
- Min length of 3 characters validation for the password.
- In the case any field is invalid, the submission button is disabled and the user cannot submit the form.
- Error messages notify the user for each error accordingly.
- Notify the user whether the submission was successful or failed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
